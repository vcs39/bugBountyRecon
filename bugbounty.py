# **Step-by-Step Bug Bounty Process (Web Applications)**

## **1. Recon on Wildcard Domain**

Before you start poking at a web app, gather as much information as possible.

### **Subdomain Enumeration**

1. **Run Amass** – Collect subdomains using OSINT and active scanning:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `amass enum -d target.com -o subdomains.txt`
    
2. **Run Subfinder** – Passive subdomain enumeration:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt`
    
3. **Run Assetfinder** – Another subdomain finder:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `assetfinder --subs-only target.com > subdomains.txt`
    
4. **Run Dnsgen** – Generate permutations of subdomains:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cat subdomains.txt | dnsgen - > permutations.txt`
    
5. **Run Massdns** – Check which subdomains are live:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `massdns -r resolvers.txt -t A -o S permutations.txt > live_subdomains.txt`
    
6. **Use Httprobe** – Filter out live domains:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cat live_subdomains.txt | httprobe > alive_domains.txt`
    
7. **Run Aquatone** – Take screenshots of alive hosts:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cat alive_domains.txt | aquatone`
    

---

## **2. Single Domain**

Now that we have our subdomains, let's dig deeper into a specific target.

### **Scanning**

1. **Nmap Scan** – Identify open ports and services:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `nmap -A -T4 target.com`
    
2. **Burp Crawler** – Crawl the web app using Burp Suite:
    - Open **Burp Suite > Target > Site Map**
    - Enable **Spidering** and collect all endpoints.
3. **FFUF for Directory & File Discovery**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt`
    
4. **Hakrawler, GAU, Paramspider** – Find hidden endpoints:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `hakrawler -url target.com gau target.com | tee urls.txt paramspider --domain target.com`
    
5. **Linkfinder for JavaScript endpoints**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `python3 linkfinder.py -i https://target.com -o output.html`
    

### **Manual Checking**

- **Shodan/Censys**: Look for exposed services.
- **Google Dorks**: Search for sensitive info (e.g., `site:target.com filetype:env`).
- **Pastebin/GitHub OSINT**: Search for leaked credentials.

---

## **3. Information Gathering**

1. **Manually explore the site** – Look for login pages, upload fields, forms, and API endpoints.
2. **Check robots.txt & sitemap.xml** – Hidden directories?
3. **Inspect different User Agents** – Does the site change for mobile, bots?
4. **Identify tech stack** – Use:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `whatweb target.com`
    
5. **Check for debugging parameters** – Look for `debug=true` or `admin=1` in URL parameters.

---

## **4. Configuration Management**

1. **Check for common admin URLs** (`/admin`, `/config.php`, etc.).
2. **Look for backup files** (`.bak`, `.old`, `.swp`).
3. **Test HTTP Methods**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl -X OPTIONS https://target.com`
    
4. **Check security headers**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl -I https://target.com`
    
    Look for `X-Frame-Options`, `CSP`, `HSTS`.

---

## **5. Secure Transmission**

1. **Check SSL Cert & HTTPS Enforcement**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sslscan target.com`
    
2. **Ensure HTTPS is used for login/session tokens.**

---

## **6. Authentication Testing**

1. **Check for User Enumeration**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `wfuzz -c -w users.txt -u https://target.com/login?user=FUZZ -H "User-Agent: fuzz"`
    
2. **Brute Force Protection** – Try a few wrong passwords and check if lockout happens.
3. **Check for Weak Password Policy** – Try simple passwords (`123456`).
4. **Check Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) bypass** – Does the app allow backup codes or SMS interception?
5. **Check default credentials** (admin/admin, root/root).
6. **Test Password Reset**:
    - Does it leak if an email exists?
    - Does it allow weak reset tokens?
7. **Check Remember Me Functionality** – Does it store plaintext passwords in cookies?

---

## **7. Session Management**

1. **Inspect Cookies** – Are they **HttpOnly** and **Secure**?
2. **Session Expiry** – Does the session expire after logout?
3. **Check for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:
    
    html
    
    Copy code
    
    `<form action="https://target.com/logout" method="POST">   <input type="submit" value="Logout"> </form>`
    
    - If clicking this logs out a user **without authentication**, the site is vulnerable.

---

## **8. Authorization Testing**

1. **Try Path Traversal**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl https://target.com/../../../../etc/passwd`
    
2. **Test for Role Escalation**:
    - Login as a low-privilege user and try accessing admin pages (`/admin`).
3. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation** – Can User A see User B’s data?

---

## **9. Data Validation**

1. **Test for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**:
    
    html
    
    Copy code
    
    `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    
2. **SQL Injection (Try basic payloads)**:
    
    sql
    
    Copy code
    
    `' OR 1=1 --`
    
3. **Command Injection**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `; cat /etc/passwd`
    
4. **Open Redirect**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `https://target.com/?redirect=https://evil.com`
    

---

## **10. Denial of Service (DoS)**

1. **Flood a form with automated requests**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `seq 1 10000 | parallel -j10 "curl -d 'user=test&pass=test' -X POST https://target.com/login"`
    
2. **Try SQL Wildcard DoS**:
    
    sql
    
    Copy code
    
    `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%a%'`
    

---

## **11. Business Logic Flaws**

- **Test feature misuse** (e.g., discount abuse, race conditions).
- **Check data integrity** – Does an order confirmation page allow price modification?

---

## **12. Cryptography Testing**

- **Check for weak encryption (MD5, SHA1)**.
- **Inspect randomness in session tokens**.

---

## **13. Risky Functionality – File Uploads**

1. **Upload a malicious file** (e.g., PHP shell).
2. **Check file validation** – Can you upload `.php` with a different extension?

---

## **14. Risky Functionality – Payment Systems**

- **Check for insecure payment handling**.
- **Check for duplicate transactions by replaying requests**.

---

## **15. HTML5 Security**

- **Test Web Storage** (Does it store sensitive data in `localStorage`?).
- **Check CORS Implementation**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl -I -H "Origin: evil.com" https://target.com`
    

---

### **Final Steps**

- Document everything (found vulnerabilities, screenshots, PoCs).
- Submit reports responsibly via the program’s guidelines.

###### ChatGPT said:

Here's an interactive Python script that automates many of the recon and scanning steps for bug bounty hunting. It uses tools like `amass`, `subfinder`, `nmap`, `ffuf`, and others to streamline your workflow. You'll need to have these tools installed for the script to work properly.

Bug Bounty Automation

This script automates several key steps of bug bounty recon, including:

- **Wildcard domain recon** using `amass`, `subfinder`, and `assetfinder`
- **Live subdomain detection** with `httprobe`
- **Screenshot capture** with `aquatone`
- **Single domain scanning** using `nmap`, `ffuf`, and `hakrawler`
- **Google Dorks recommendations** for sensitive information discovery

### **Usage:**

Save the script as `bug_bounty.py`, then run:

bash

Copy code

`python3 bug_bounty.py -d target.com`

Would you like any additional features, such as integrating `Burp Suite` automation or `SQL injection` testing? 🚀

##### You said:

module 2642 error

###### ChatGPT said:

​

##### You said:

module 2642

###### ChatGPT said:

It looks like you're referring to a module error related to `2642`. Could you clarify what issue you're encountering? Are you getting a specific error message related to this module, or is there an issue with a particular function in the script? Let me know so I can help debug it. 🚀

##### You said:

error

###### ChatGPT said:

If you're encountering an error related to **"module 2642"**, it might be due to a missing or incorrectly referenced module. Since there is no module explicitly named `2642`, let's troubleshoot:

### **Possible Issues and Fixes**

#### **1. Missing Dependencies**

Make sure you have all required tools installed on your system:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y amass subfinder assetfinder httprobe aquatone nmap ffuf hakrawler`

If using Python packages:

bash

Copy code

`pip install argparse`

#### **2. Check for Incorrect Imports**

- The script only imports `os`, `subprocess`, and `argparse`, none of which reference `2642`. If you're running it in a virtual environment, ensure it's activated:

bash

Copy code

`source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows`

#### **3. Run Script with Debugging**

Try running the script with debugging enabled to capture any module-related issues:

bash

Copy code

`python3 -v bug_bounty.py -d example.com`

This will output detailed debugging logs.

#### **4. Verify Python Version**

Make sure you are using Python 3:

bash

Copy code

`python3 --version`

If using Python 2, switch to Python 3:

bash

Copy code

`python3 bug_bounty.py -d example.com`

#### **5. Reinstall Python Modules**

If the error persists, reinstall Python modules:

bash

Copy code

`pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall subprocess argparse`

If you have an exact error message, share it, and I'll pinpoint the fix faster. 🚀

##### You said:

Google Dorks: Search for sensitive info (e.g., site:target.com filetype:env). Pastebin/GitHub OSINT: Search for leaked credentials. 3. Information Gathering Manually explore the site – Look for login pages, upload fields, forms, and API endpoints. Check robots.txt & sitemap.xml – Hidden directories? Inspect different User Agents – Does the site change for mobile, bots? Identify tech stack – Use: whatweb target.com Check for debugging parameters – Look for debug=true or admin=1 in URL parameters. 4. Configuration Management Check for common admin URLs (/admin, /config.php, etc.). Look for backup files (.bak, .old, .swp). Test HTTP Methods: curl -X OPTIONS https://target.com Check security headers: curl -I https://target.com Look for X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS. 5. Secure Transmission Check SSL Cert & HTTPS Enforcement: sslscan target.com Ensure HTTPS is used for login/session tokens. 6. Authentication Testing Check for User Enumeration: wfuzz -c -w users.txt -u https://target.com/login?user=FUZZ -H "User-Agent: fuzz" Brute Force Protection – Try a few wrong passwords and check if lockout happens. Check for Weak Password Policy – Try simple passwords (123456). Check Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) bypass – Does the app allow backup codes or SMS interception? Check default credentials (admin/admin, root/root). Test Password Reset: Does it leak if an email exists? Does it allow weak reset tokens? Check Remember Me Functionality – Does it store plaintext passwords in cookies? 7. Session Management Inspect Cookies – Are they HttpOnly and Secure?

Want me to tailor this guide into an interactive script for automation? 🚀 You said: yes ChatGPT said: Here's an interactive Python script that automates many of the recon and scanning steps for bug bounty hunting. It uses tools like amass, subfinder, nmap, ffuf, and others to streamline your workflow. You'll need to have these tools installed for the script to work properly. This script automates several key steps of bug bounty recon, including: Wildcard domain recon using amass, subfinder, and assetfinder Live subdomain detection with httprobe Screenshot capture with aquatone Single domain scanning using nmap, ffuf, and hakrawler Google Dorks recommendations for sensitive information discovery Usage: Save the script as bug_bounty.py, then run: python3 bug_bounty.py -d target.com Would you like any additional features, such as integrating Burp Suite automation or SQL injection testing? 🚀 You said: Asked ChatGPT how to debug ChatGPT said: I've added debugging features to the script by printing outputs and errors for each command execution. If a command fails, it will now display an error message. Let me know if you need additional debugging enhancements! 🚀 ChatGPT said: I reviewed and fixed a bug where subprocess.run did not properly handle command failures. Now, it raises an exception when a command fails, ensuring proper error handling. Let me know if you need further refinements! 🚀 ChatGPT said: I reviewed the code and found no bugs. It is well-structured and properly handles errors. Let me know if you need any modifications. 🚀 You said: redo ChatGPT said: I have updated the code to ensure command execution outputs are printed directly, improving debugging visibility. Let me know if you need any further refinements. 🚀 You said: Asked ChatGPT fix lin3 2164 2655 2642 ChatGPT said: I have fixed the identified issues by ensuring command outputs are properly assigned to variables before being printed. Let me know if you need further adjustments. 🚀 You said: Asked ChatGPT what is this error ChatGPT said: Could you specify the exact error message you're encountering? That would help pinpoint the issue and provide a fix. ChatGPT said: I have reviewed and fixed potential issues in the code. Let me know if you need further modifications. 🚀 You said: Asked ChatGPT module 2642 ChatGPT said: You said: module 2642 error ChatGPT said: ​ You said: module 2642 ChatGPT said: It looks like you're referring to a module error related to 2642. Could you clarify what issue you're encountering? Are you getting a specific error message related to this module, or is there an issue with a particular function in the script? Let me know so I can help debug it. 🚀 You said: error ChatGPT said: If you're encountering an error related to "module 2642", it might be due to a missing or incorrectly referenced module. Since there is no module explicitly named 2642, let's troubleshoot: Possible Issues and Fixes 1. Missing Dependencies Make sure you have all required tools installed on your system: sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y amass subfinder assetfinder httprobe aquatone nmap ffuf hakrawler If using Python packages: pip install argparse 2. Check for Incorrect Imports The script only imports os, subprocess, and argparse, none of which reference 2642. If you're running it in a virtual environment, ensure it's activated: source venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac venv\Scripts\activate # Windows 3. Run Script with Debugging Try running the script with debugging enabled to capture any module-related issues: python3 -v bug_bounty.py -d example.com This will output detailed debugging logs. 4. Verify Python Version Make sure you are using Python 3: python3 --version If using Python 2, switch to Python 3: python3 bug_bounty.py -d example.com 5. Reinstall Python Modules If the error persists, reinstall Python modules: pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall subprocess argparse If you have an exact error message, share it, and I'll pinpoint the fix faster. 🚀 You said: Asked ChatGPT [warn]: usage: [-h] -d DOMAIN [warn]: : error: the following arguments are required: -d/--domain error ChatGPT said: Answer in chat instead I have updated the script to handle unrecognized arguments properly and prevent the argparse error.
